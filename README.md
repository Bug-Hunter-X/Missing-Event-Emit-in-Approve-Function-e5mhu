# Missing Event Emit in Solidity Approve Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in Solidity smart contracts: forgetting to emit an event in the `approve` function.  While the contract might function correctly in basic use cases, this omission can cause problems.  Specifically, it prevents off-chain applications from reliably tracking approvals, leading to discrepancies between the perceived and actual approval status.

The `approve` function, crucial for ERC-20 token approvals, should emit an `Approval` event for off-chain tracking.  The absence of this event can lead to unexpected behavior, especially in situations involving multiple transactions and complex interactions.

The solution demonstrates the correct way to use the `Approval` event to ensure consistency and enable off-chain tools to accurately monitor approvals.
